Usually, I would approach with extreme caution. I rarely read a series when I've been assured that it gets good after six books. When people tell me that, I simply quietly encourage them to read the Fever Series and avert eye contact.",

I can shout at my hands and tell them they are ungrateful! They should have clapped this authorâ€™s creativity for this controversial, unique, fantastic plot and good characterization but well, my hands made the right decision! You know why! Okay keep reading and stop yawning in front of me!",

And it was a rather atmospheric show with the exception of that charred body too naturalistically (for my liking!) shown, which I managed to watch during my lunch. Totally ruined that freaking lunch! Offputting, that's what it was. And it put me off for, like, 5 years in reading the series. But now I still am here, ready to enjoy this installment to my everlasting paranormal reading addiction. And from the very start this novel feels superb. I think I'll stay with this series for the long run.",
